"""
--- Prereqs possible ---
Write a function, prereqs_possible, that takes in a number of courses (n) and prerequisites as arguments. Courses have ids ranging from 0 through n - 1. A single prerequisite of (A, B) means that course A must be taken before course B. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to complete all courses.
